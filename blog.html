				<h2>Long Term Engagement Lessons From Animal Crossing: New Leaf</h2>
				<span class="date">July 25th, 2013</span>
				<div>
					<p>
						Animal Crossing: New Leaf came out a few weeks ago and one thing that amazes me about this game is how I’m still playing it almost every day, and I’m not the only one! People I follow on twitter and tumblr are still talking about the game and posting photos of their new haircut or furniture in the game. I have played a number of casual games in the past and I usually don’t make it past a couple of days. In previous Animal Crossings I have also felt the urge to come back and play over and over again, although not quite as much as this newest installment. What about Animal Crossing keeps me and many others coming back? Here are a few of my theories after taking a while to think about it.
					</p>
					<p>
						First is the collections aspect of the game. Collecting is the major game mechanic in Animal Crossing, whether it’s collecting bugs and fish for the museum, collecting clothes to change your outfit, or furniture for your house, Animal Crossing is all about collecting. Often there are no explicit rewards for this collecting, except for the museum where you can get badges and upgrades for the museum and also fill up the museum with your finds and read about them. However many of the rewards for collecting are implicit, it is just the player who wants to fill out their encyclopedia or catalog to say they did. The great design behind getting players to come back in this regard is you can’t collect everything all at once, even if you spent all day playing. There are bugs and fish only available during certain seasons of the year. Stores only stock once a day and only 4 fossils can be found each day. Also there are even longer term steps that hold you back, such as stores only upgrade after you fulfill certain requirements, and even then they often take a week or 2 after the previous upgrade to upgrade again. However these waits are always achievable so you never feel like anything is out of reach eventually.

				<h2>Looking Back: Diddy Kong Racing</h2>
				<span class="date">July 22th, 2013</span>
				<div>
					<p>
						A few months ago I got into watching speed runs of old games and one that got my attention was a speed run of Diddy Kong Racing. I decided to go back and play the classic title for the Nintendo 64. I remembered having a blast playing it and also that is got pretty difficult in the later stages of the game (which the speed run makes look all too easy). So I loaded it up and instantly got transported back to 1997. The music and the characters are so memorable and happy it’s hard not to love the styling of this game. I started playing and watched the very short introduction the game has which gives no story or explanation for the setting or the actions of the characters. Before playing this game I didn’t remember what the story was but I thought there was more of a story element to the game. Having the game be so open with no explanation and being a kid with an imagination is a big part of why this game and many others in its era are so nostalgic and memorable to people. With the limitations of the systems and the youth of game design many of these games were open to interpretation and allowed people to fill in the blanks and create their own experience alongside the experience designed into the game.
					</p>

						The gameplay is still very enjoyable to me, especially after learning some tricks from the speed run, such as tapping accelerate to be able to gain a slightly higher top speed. There is something about arcade style driving where the controls don’t try to emulate real life driving. I found this game much easier than when I played it as a kid. I got through the game pretty quickly. I don’t think I ever beat the “last boss” before and there is a bonus world after you beat the last boss and all the tournaments. I remember my brother beat the game so I used to play the extra levels on his save file but this time I was able to do it on my own and it was very rewarding.
					</p>
					<p>
						Overall I think Diddy Kong Racing is a great game; the game has very fun and technical controls, a visual style that still holds up, a great hub world linking to interesting race worlds, and a fun little story, even if it isn’t much of one. I’m not the biggest fan of racing games but I really liked the approach this game took, and I would love to see a similar game made today, with an over world and cartoony worlds to play in with a nice progression, I haven’t seen another game like it since.
