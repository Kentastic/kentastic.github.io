				<h2>Looking Back: Diddy Kong Racing</h2>

						A few months ago I got into watching speed runs of old games and one that got my attention was a speed run of Diddy Kong Racing. I decided to go back and play the classic title for the Nintendo 64. I remembered having a blast playing it and also that is got pretty difficult in the later stages of the game (which the speed run makes look all too easy). So I loaded it up and instantly got transported back to 1997. The music and the characters are so memorable and happy it’s hard not to love the styling of this game. I started playing and watched the very short introduction the game has which gives no story or explanation for the setting or the actions of the characters. Before playing this game I didn’t remember what the story was but I thought there was more of a story element to the game. Having the game be so open with no explanation and being a kid with an imagination is a big part of why this game and many others in its era are so nostalgic and memorable to people. With the limitations of the systems and the youth of game design many of these games were open to interpretation and allowed people to fill in the blanks and create their own experience alongside the experience designed into the game.

						The gameplay is still very enjoyable to me, especially after learning some tricks from the speed run, such as tapping accelerate to be able to gain a slightly higher top speed. There is something about arcade style driving where the controls don’t try to emulate real life driving. I found this game much easier than when I played it as a kid. I got through the game pretty quickly. I don’t think I ever beat the “last boss” before and there is a bonus world after you beat the last boss and all the tournaments. I remember my brother beat the game so I used to play the extra levels on his save file but this time I was able to do it on my own and it was very rewarding.

						Overall I think Diddy Kong Racing is a great game; the game has very fun and technical controls, a visual style that still holds up, a great hub world linking to interesting race worlds, and a fun little story, even if it isn’t much of one. I’m not the biggest fan of racing games but I really liked the approach this game took, and I would love to see a similar game made today, with an over world and cartoony worlds to play in with a nice progression, I haven’t seen another game like it since.
