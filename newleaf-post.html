				<h2>Long Term Engagement Lessons From Animal Crossing: New Leaf</h2>

					<p>
						Animal Crossing: New Leaf came out a few weeks ago and one thing that amazes me about this game is how I’m still playing it almost every day, and I’m not the only one! People I follow on twitter and tumblr are still talking about the game and posting photos of their new haircut or furniture in the game. I have played a number of casual games in the past and I usually don’t make it past a couple of days. In previous Animal Crossings I have also felt the urge to come back and play over and over again, although not quite as much as this newest installment. What about Animal Crossing keeps me and many others coming back? Here are a few of my theories after taking a while to think about it.
					</p>
					<p>
						First is the collections aspect of the game. Collecting is the major game mechanic in Animal Crossing, whether it’s collecting bugs and fish for the museum, collecting clothes to change your outfit, or furniture for your house, Animal Crossing is all about collecting. Often there are no explicit rewards for this collecting, except for the museum where you can get badges and upgrades for the museum and also fill up the museum with your finds and read about them. However many of the rewards for collecting are implicit, it is just the player who wants to fill out their encyclopedia or catalog to say they did. The great design behind getting players to come back in this regard is you can’t collect everything all at once, even if you spent all day playing. There are bugs and fish only available during certain seasons of the year. Stores only stock once a day and only 4 fossils can be found each day. Also there are even longer term steps that hold you back, such as stores only upgrade after you fulfill certain requirements, and even then they often take a week or 2 after the previous upgrade to upgrade again. However these waits are always achievable so you never feel like anything is out of reach eventually.
